# ThInK Mechanisms: Theory Informed Kinetic Mechanisms

## Philosophy
In a highly-collobarative effort, ThInK mechanisms are constructed primarily with modern Master Equation computations for complex multiple-well multi-channel reactions and rigorous pressure dependence and supplemented with theory-informed estimated parameters and experimental measurements. They additionally include theory-informed thermodynamic properties (e.g., sourced from purely ab initio heats of formation and partition functions) and transport properties (e.g., computed Lennard-Jones collision parameters).
