# ThInK Mechanisms: Theory Informed Kinetic Mechanisms

## Philosophy
ThInK mechanisms are constructed primarily from modern Master Equation computations of first principles rate constants for complex multiple-well multi-channel reactions with rigorous pressure dependence. They are supplemented with theory-informed thermodynamic properties (e.g., sourced from ab initio heats of formation and partition functions) and transport properties (e.g., computed Lennard-Jones collision parameters) as well as data from experimental measurements.
